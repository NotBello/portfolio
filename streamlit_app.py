                Greetings! I'm Venujan Malaiyandi, but you may know me as 'Bello'. I hail from the vibrant lands of Sri Lanka but spent my formative years soaking in the bustling energy of Chennai. With a passion for continuous learning and exploration, I've eagerly delved into the realm of technology, honing my skills and nurturing my curiosity every step of the way.

During my undergraduate journey, my focus has been on the intriguing intersection of offensive web security and classical machine learning techniques, with a burgeoning interest in the depths of deep learning. My ultimate aim? To seamlessly blend offensive security practices with the power of deep learning algorithms.

Alongside my academic pursuits, I've eagerly pursued certifications in diverse areas such as AR/VR, SEO, and administration, all in a quest to discover where my true passion lies within the vast landscape of technology.

But wait, there's more! I'm absolutely captivated by the world of autonomous systems, UAVs, and dronesâ€”particularly within the realm of defense technology.

With boundless enthusiasm and a relentless drive for innovation, I'm excited to embark on this journey of exploration, discovery, and creation within the ever-evolving tech landscape. Let's connect and discover the endless possibilities together
